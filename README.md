# Machine Learning Mapping sample

This is a quick demo/showcase of the workflow of getting Tensorflow.js working with an image service in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.


## The Tech
1. Models trained using [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train).
2. Machine Learning Library is [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
3. Mapping API used is the ArcGIS API for JavaScript


## Getting Started

If you don't know what image service to use... You'd need a [developer subscription](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to use the following image service - https://tiledbasemaps.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer.

This sample is built to be using the code exported from [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). Simply place the files in the .models/ folder.
